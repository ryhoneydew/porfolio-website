When I was taking my senior checkpoint at Fullstack Academy, I was stuck at writing the correct redux-thunk creator in my redux store, which made me realize that I didnâ€™t quite understand how redux-thunk works. When I was reviewing this topic, I saw quite a few articles regarding different redux middleware, especially redux-thunk and redux-saga. I want to figure out how either of them performs and more importantly, which one should I use in my future projects?
